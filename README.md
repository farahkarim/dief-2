R package for computing diefficiency metrics dief@t and dief@k.

The metrics dief@t and dief@k allow for measuring the diefficiency during an elapsed time period t or while k answers are produced, respectively. dief@t and dief@k rely on the computation of the area under the curve of answer traces, and thus capturing the answer rate concentration over a time interval.

## Download and Install
To download the development version of the `dief` package directly from GitHub, type the following at the R command line:
```r
# If you have not installed the "devtools" package.
install.packages("devtools")
# Install the dief package.
devtools::install_github("maribelacosta/dief")
```
## Examples 
```r
library("dief")

# Use answer traces provided in the package: Compare three approaches "Selective", "Not Adaptive", "Random" when executing the test "Q9.sparql".
traces
	
# Plot answer traces for test "Q9.sparql".
plotAnswerTrace(traces, "Q9.sparql")
	
# Compute dief@t when t is the time where the fastest approach produced the last answer.
dieft(traces, "Q9.sparql")
	
# Compute dief@t after 7.5 time units (seconds) of execution. 
dieft(traces, "Q9.sparql", 7.5)
```
